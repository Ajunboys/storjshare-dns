### Contents of `package.json`

> Feel free to scrub any information you don't want to be made public, we are
> mostly interested in the semver ranges for your packages and the scripts you
> are using to run your app

### Value of `npm list`

> I.E. run `npm list 2>&1 > npm-list.txt` on Linux

### What operating system and version?

> These are relevant even if you are reporting an issue found in a web browser
>
> * **Windows and OSx** Getting this data is relatively straight forward and standardized
> * **Linux** you can use [getos](github.com/retrohacker/getos) for detailed system information
> * **Mobile** Include the version of the OS (I.E. Android 7.1.1) and the model of the phone (I.E. Nexus 5x) so we can easily lookup the relevant specs (i.e. screen size and memory).

### What browser and version? (if you are using the package in the browser)

> N/A for problems encountered in Node.js

### Please describe the problem
